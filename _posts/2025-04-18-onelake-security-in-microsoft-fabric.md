If you're new to Fabric, think of it like this: It‚Äôs a unified platform for data and AI ‚Äî and at the heart of it is OneLake ‚Äî your single, massive data lake for your whole organization.

Now, OneLake Security makes sure that no matter where your data is used ‚Äî Power BI, SQL, Notebooks ‚Äî the security rules stay consistent. ‚úÖ One copy of data. One set of access rules. No duplicates. No confusion.

### OneLake Data Access Interface

You start in your Lakehouse. Click ‚ÄúManage OneLake Data Access‚Äù ‚Äî and you‚Äôre in the role manager.

Every data item starts with a default role.This gives workspace users with write access the ability to work with everything.
But you can customize this completely.

### Role Creation

Just give it a name, then pick the data you want this role to access ‚Äî tables, schemas, folders, even shortcuts.

This is a grant-by-assignment model ‚Äî Users don‚Äôt get access by default. You explicitly give access by assigning them to a role.

You can add individual users, user groups, service principals, or managed identities.
Once you‚Äôre happy, click Create.

### Column Level and Row Level Security Options

Now, let‚Äôs talk fine-grained control.
Need to hide specific columns? Turn on Column-Level Security.
Want to limit rows based on department, region, or user role? Use Row-Level Security with T-SQL.

You can combine these into one powerful role, or break them out into specialized ones.

### Example Setup of Multiple Roles

Here‚Äôs a real-world example:
Suppliers Readers ‚Üí Can only see the Suppliers table.
Customer Data Readers ‚Üí Can view Customers and Orders, but with sensitive columns hidden.
HR Data U.S. ‚Üí Can only see U.S. employee rows.

You can even apply roles to shortcuts ‚Äî and the security still holds. üîê Security travels with the data.

### Power BI, SQL Endpoint and Notebooks in action

The cool part? These roles work across every tool.

- In Power BI: only allowed data appears in reports
- In Notebooks: data science work respects your role
- In SQL: users can query, but only what they‚Äôre permitted to see

Even if someone tries to browse OneLake directly ‚Äî üîí Access is still locked down.

### Summary

OneLake Security brings cross-engine, centralized data protection to your lake. No more managing security in five different places. One place. One definition. OneLake.

It‚Äôs now in preview ‚Äî go check it out and give your data the protection it deserves!
