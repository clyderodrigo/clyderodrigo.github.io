Big news from Microsoft Fabricâ€”Copilot and AI capabilities are now available to *everyone* on paid SKUs. Yup, no more jumping through hoops. Just power, right at your fingertips.

### Whatâ€™s Changing

Starting now, if you're on an F2 SKU or higherâ€”you get access to Copilot and AI tools like Fabric data agents. That means faster insights, natural language queries, and next-level decision-makingâ€”no extra licenses, no friction.

### Why It Matters

Whether you're an analyst, engineer, or execâ€”Copilot can help you generate reports, automate tasks, and explore dataâ€”all with simple prompts. It understands your orgâ€™s data context and cuts through the clutter.

### How To Get Started

If you're in the US or EU, Copilot is on by default. If not, go to Admin settings in Fabric or Power BI, and enable Copilot and Azure OpenAI. A few clicksâ€”and youâ€™re live.

### For Fabric Copilot Capacity Users

Using Fabric Copilot Capacity? Hereâ€™s what you do:

1. Admin enables Copilot org-wide.
2. Set authorized capacity admins.
3. Assign users to Copilot capacity.

   Boomâ€”no more setup needed.

### Summary

AI in Fabric isn't just smartâ€”itâ€™s seamless. It's about working better, faster, and together. And now, it's for  *every team* , not just the top-tier ones.

Copilot is here. The future of work just got easier.
